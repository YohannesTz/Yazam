# Yazam
attempt at audio fingerprinting from Microphone. the project uses [this C++](https://github.com/salsowelim/dejavu_cpp_port) and 
[this React Native](https://github.com/salsowelim/mobileAfp) as a basis.

# Prerequests

- Android NDK tool chain fully setted up.
- OpenCV for Android correctly setup
- Boost for Android (I was not able to do it. but I left a portable sha1 implementation. I hope you could make it work 😉 )

# Screenshots (Spoiler: Not that interesting😁)
