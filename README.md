# Yazam
attempt at audio fingerprinting from Microphone. the project uses [this C++](https://github.com/salsowelim/dejavu_cpp_port) and 
[this React Native](https://github.com/salsowelim/mobileAfp) as a basis.

# Prerequests
- Android NDK tool chain fully setted up.
- OpenCV for Android correctly setup
- Boost for Android (I was not able to do it). but I left a portable sha1 implementation. I hope you can make it work üòâ )

# Screenshots (Spoiler: Not that interestingüòÅ)
if you run it correctly, you will see a bunch of gibberish on the screen. that is, hopefully, the peaks detected from your
mic with their respective offsets.

# Final Notes
if you want to see my notes while doing this. Any mistakes that you spot can be very helpful. and I hope I can return to this in the future. I would really love if you find
this project helpful and apply it in any way!
