# Yazam
attempt at audio fingerprinting from Microphone. the project uses [this C++](https://github.com/salsowelim/dejavu_cpp_port) and 
[this React Native](https://github.com/salsowelim/mobileAfp) as a basis.

# Prerequests
- Android NDK tool chain fully setted up.
- OpenCV for Android correctly setup
- Boost for Android (I was not able to do it. but I left a portable sha1 implementation. I hope you could make it work üòâ )

# Screenshots (Spoiler: Not that interestingüòÅ)
if you were able to run it correctly, you will see a bunch of gibberish on the screen. that is (hopefully) the peaks detected from your
mic with their respective offset.

# Final Notes
if you want to see my notes while doing this. you can follow up [those post](https://t.me/thoughts_when_its_raining/347) from my channel.
any mistakes that you spot can be very helpful. and I hope I can return to this in the future. I would really love if you find
this project helpful and applied it in any way!
